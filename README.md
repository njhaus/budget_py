# About

## Specifications
This budgeting app was created as a project for FreeCodeCamp. Some of test.py and test_module.py contain the unit tests the code needed to pass in order to be accepted. I also added tests on my own to enhance the testing and aid in debuggging. Furthermore, I added the CLI features to include user customization and interactivity to the program, which were beyond the scope of the required project.
